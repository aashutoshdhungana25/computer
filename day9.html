        <h2>Types of Relationships in DBMS</h2>
        
        <h3>1. One-to-One (1:1) Relationship</h3>
        <p>In a one-to-one relationship, each record in Table A corresponds to exactly one record in Table B, and vice versa.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> A table of employees and a table of employee IDs. Each employee has a unique employee ID, and each ID corresponds to only one employee.</li>
            <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Typically implemented by having a foreign key in one table that references the primary key of another table, with a unique constraint on the foreign key column.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. One-to-Many (1:N) Relationship</h3>
        <p>In a one-to-many relationship, a single record in Table A can be associated with multiple records in Table B, but each record in Table B is associated with only one record in Table A.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> A table of customers and a table of orders. Each customer can have multiple orders, but each order is placed by only one customer.</li>
            <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Implemented by placing a foreign key in Table B that references the primary key of Table A.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Many-to-One (N:1) Relationship</h3>
        <p>This is essentially the inverse of the one-to-many relationship. Multiple records in Table A are associated with a single record in Table B.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> A table of orders and a table of customers. Each order is associated with one customer, but a customer can have multiple orders.</li>
            <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Implemented by placing a foreign key in Table A that references the primary key of Table B.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Many-to-Many (M:N) Relationship</h3>
        <p>In a many-to-many relationship, multiple records in Table A can be associated with multiple records in Table B. This type of relationship usually requires a junction table (also called an associative table) to manage the associations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> A table of students and a table of courses. A student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students enrolled.</li>
            <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Implemented by creating a junction table with foreign keys referencing the primary keys of Table A and Table B. This junction table holds the associations between the records.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Self-Referencing Relationship</h3>
        <p>A self-referencing relationship is a type of relationship where a table has a foreign key that references its own primary key. This is used to represent hierarchical data or recursive relationships.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> An employee table where each employee has a manager who is also an employee. Here, the table will have a foreign key column referencing the primary key of the same table.</li>
            <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Implemented by adding a foreign key in the same table that references the table's primary key.</li>
        </ul>
