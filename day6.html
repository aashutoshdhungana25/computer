    <h2>How to create a Gmail Account?</h2>
    <p>
        Creating a Gmail account is straightforward:
        <ol>
            <li>Visit <a href="https://www.gmail.com" target="_blank">gmail.com</a>.</li>
            <li>How to create a Gmail Account?
                Creating a Gmail account is straightforward:
                
                Visit gmail.com.
                Click on the "Create account" link.
                Fill out the registration form with your name, desired email address, password, and other required information.
                Follow the on-screen prompts to verify your account.
                Once verified, you can start using Gmail to send and receive emails.
                
                How to create a GitHub Account?
                Creating a GitHub account allows you to host your code repositories and collaborate with others:
                
                Go to github.com/join.
                Enter your desired username, email address, and password.
                Complete the registration process by verifying your email address.
                Once registered, you have access to create and manage repositories, collaborate with others, and contribute to open-source projects.
                
                How to connect VS Code Editor to GitHub Account?
                Connecting Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to your GitHub account enables seamless integration for version control and collaboration:
                
                Install the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension in VS Code.
                Sign in to GitHub within VS Code by clicking on your profile icon in the sidebar and selecting "Sign in to GitHub".
                Authorize VS Code to access your GitHub account.
                To clone a repository, press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac), type "Git: Clone" and enter the repository URL.
                After making changes to your code, you can stage, commit, and push changes directly from VS Code to GitHub.
                
                How to clone/pull repository from GitHub?
                Cloning and pulling repositories from GitHub allow you to download and synchronize code changes:
                
                Clone a repository using the command git clone in your terminal or VS Code's integrated terminal.
                To pull changes from the remote repository to your local machine, use the command git pull. This fetches and merges changes made by others.
                
                How to push repository/folder to GitHub?
                Pushing changes from your local repository to GitHub enables collaboration and version control:
                
                Add changes to the staging area using git add . for all changes or git add for specific files.
                Commit changes with a descriptive message using git commit -m "Commit message".
                Push changes to the remote repository on GitHub using git push origin main (replace main with your branch name if different).
                Authenticate if prompted and your changes will be reflected on GitHub.
                
                How to publish the repository as a live site?
                GitHub Pages allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository:
                
                Go to your repository on GitHub.
                Click on the "Settings" tab.
                Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
                Select the branch you want to publish (often main or master).
                Click "Save" or "Publish" to deploy your site.
